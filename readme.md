# Taipei Karting web app

Prototype Web app for the Taipei International Karting Association (TIKA). Fist SPA project implemented entirely by myself in order to learn the Vue MVVC library and Laravel framework.
After the prototype was finished and went live on a VPS, the club disbandend and the project was discontinued. I later moved on to Ruby for backend and React for frontend.

SPA frontend built with Vue 1.0 and API backend built with PHP Laravel Framework 5.1.

Live race progress tracking and notifiations with WebSockets and Redis.
